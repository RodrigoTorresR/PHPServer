		In the begining, Tim created the HyperText Markup Languaje. The internet
		was without form and void, and text was upon the face of the monito and
		the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the keyboard. And Tim sai,
		Let there be links; andthere were links. And Tim saw the links were good;
		and Tim separated the links from the text. Tim called the links Anchors,
		and the text He called Other Stuff. And the whole thing together was the
		firts Web Page.
